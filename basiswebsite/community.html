                <h3>Partnership</h3>
                <p>As we announced back in March, we hit some serious bumps along the path in our pursuit to grow Open Wear.</p>
                <p>Now we are happy to announce a partnership with Snowcountry.eu, one of Europe's key online shops for freeride gear.</p>
                <p>Thanks to this new partnership, we can now rely on the expertise and infrastructure Snowcountry.eu has been building up over the last 11 years. Which we believe to be a solid foundation for new growth.</p>

                <h3>Next steps?</h3>
                <p>The focus for the coming months, this winter season, will be on the Free One and Open One Series products we had and gather further feedback from you, our community.</p>
                <p>During the coming months, we’ll discuss with Snowcountry how we can further grow the brand and our partnership. More information will follow as soon as we know more.</p>

                <h3>Snowcountry</h3>
                <p>So who are these helping angels?</p>
                <p>Dennis &amp; Thijs started Snowcountry back on October 1st, 2008. The reason?</p>
                <p>Back then, many of the products we found in the Alps or on the internet were not for sale in our flat country or on the internet.</p>
                <p>With Snowcountry, they focus on the passionate skiers and snowboarders spending their time searching for powder, pulling tricks in the park and climbing high mountains far away from the slopes.</p>

                <h3>Dennis van de Pol</h3>
                <p>Dennis has a background as ski- and board instructor (Landes Ski- and Snowboard-instructor).</p>
                <p>In the last years, he spent most of his days searching for powder in the Alps, Scandinavia, North and South America.</p>

                <h3>Thijs de Jong</h3>
                <p>Somewhere at the beginning of this century, Thijs came in contact with a group of Dutch freeskiers trough skizone.nl which triggered his addiction to (free)skiing.</p>
                <p>A few years later he spent two seasons as a ski-bum in Haute-Nendaz (Verbier). There he spent his days climbing the highest mountains searching for the best powder far-away from the slopes.</p>
                <p>Thijs has also been a test skier for White Freeski magazine and during the summer and autumn, he works on his freestyle skills at Freestyle Holland.</p>
